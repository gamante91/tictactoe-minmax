**a simple Tic-Tac-Toe bot**

The aim of this repo was to develop a simple bot that plays Tic-Tac-Toe using the **minimax algorithm** from the classic [adversarial search literature](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence/Search/Adversarial_search/Minimax_Search).

**Environment**:

The classic Tic-Tac-Toe is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

```
+-----+
|X| | |   "O" represents a move done by the bot
| |O| |   "X" represents a move dony by the human player
| | |X|
+-----+
```
